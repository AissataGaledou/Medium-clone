      <p>At first, coding felt like reading a foreign language with no dictionary. I had imposter syndrome, and tutorials felt overwhelming.</p>
      <p>But then I changed how I learned: instead of passively watching videos, I started typing code, breaking it, and fixing it. That’s when things clicked.</p>
      <p>I joined online communities, followed coding challenges, and gave myself permission to fail. Slowly, my code started working. Today, I help others who feel the same way I did.</p>
      <p>If you're feeling stuck, remember: confidence comes from practice, not perfection.</p>
