        <h1>Coding My First App: A Beginner's Guide to JavaScript</h1>
        <p><em>By Aissata Galedou · April 2025</em></p>
    
        <article>
          <p>My first app wasn’t fancy. It was a simple to-do list that let me add and delete tasks. But it was mine — and I built it with just HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.</p>
          <p>I started by creating a basic HTML structure and learned how to use JavaScript to dynamically update the DOM. I didn't know much about event listeners, but I followed tutorials and made mistakes until it worked.</p>
          <p>What I learned:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>How to target elements using <code>document.querySelector</code></li>
            <li>How to listen for click and submit events</li>
            <li>How to store temporary data in an array</li>
          </ul>
          <p>If you're just starting, don’t wait to build something. Start small, and grow as you go!</p>
